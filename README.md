[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/industrial-data-space/trusted-connector.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/industrial-data-space/trusted-connector)

The _Trusted Connector_ is an Apache Karaf-based platform for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). It supports Docker and trust|me as containerization environments and provides the following features:

* Message routing and conversion between protocols with Apache Camel
* _Apps_ in isolated containers
* Data flow- and data usage control
* An Apache Camel component for secure communication and remote attestation between Connectors.

# How to build & run

Please see the [Github documentation page](https://industrial-data-space.github.io/trusted-connector-documentation/docs/dev_core/)

# How to contribute
