/*
Now this is tricky. We need to build a custom assembly of karaf with a few features:
- included ids feature
- deactivated all other repos, basically it beeing 'offline'
- add a bunch of configuration files in etc (although we need to re-verify, which of them are really necessary

Since gradle still has no karaf-assembly plugin we need to do this using maven (meh!)
