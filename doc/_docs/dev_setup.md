Parts of the Trusted Connector have been released as open source.

* The underlying operating system _trustm3_, featuring verification and strong container-based isolation of apps, trusted boot, and the foundations of remote attestation is available under a GPL v2 license.
* The Core Platform components will be made available under a non-copyleft license.
