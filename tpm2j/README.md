# tpm2j

TPM2J is a cross-platform object-oriented API using Java to access the TPM in version 2.0.
It is based on the library TPM/J which was developed as part of the research project at MIT by Luis Sarmenta.
At the moment only the main data structures, used by the ids, are included (moslty rsa). In the future commands, routines and other data structures (like the ones used for ecc) will also be included.
